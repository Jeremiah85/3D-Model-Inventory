## General Info

This is a simple application to help manage my 3D model collection.
Previously I kept my list of models in a spreadsheet and so I thought an
actual dedicated application would be more sustainable in the long run.
I am taking the opportunity to teach myself Python and SQLite in the process
since my only other experience with writing code is with Powershell.

## Technologies

* Python 3.10
* SQLite 3
* Tkinter

## Setup

To run this project, navigate to the application's directory and execute
model_inv.py:

```python
$ py model_inv.py
```

## Status

This is a hobby project and I am releasing it on the off chance someone else
may find it useful. If you do find any part useful, I'd love to hear about it.
